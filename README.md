# Python_Week_Two_Assignment-List-Data-structure
This exercise is focusing on one of the Python built-in data structures namely: the List, from the time we start creating an empty list, appending the list, inserting an element  in a particular position, extending current list, removing an element from a certain position as well as sorting list elements. Finally, printing an index of one  value.
